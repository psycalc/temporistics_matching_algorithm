# Typologies Distribution Plan

This repo currently stores all typologies in a single place, which might not suit future scalability requirements. We plan to split typologies into dedicated repositories so that each repo can act as an independent microservice (or MCP-service).

- Each typology will live in its own repository.
- Services will communicate via an API layer.
- Keep this note as a reminder to revisit the architecture and perform the refactoring.
