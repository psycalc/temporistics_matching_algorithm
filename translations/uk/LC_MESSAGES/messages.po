"CALLBACKS\n"
"\n"
"    Most callback functions are of the same general format.  For a "
"command line\n"
"    argument like\n"
"      --foo-callback 'BODY'\n"
"\n"
"    the following code will be compiled and called:\n"
"      def foo_callback(foo):\n"
"        BODY\n"
"\n"
"    The exception on callbacks is the --file-info-callback, which will be"
"\n"
"    discussed further below.\n"
"\n"
"    Given the callback style, we can thus make a simple callback to "
"replace\n"
"    'Jon' with 'John' in author/committer/tagger names:\n"
"      git filter-repo --name-callback 'return name.replace(b\"Jon\", "
"b\"John\")'\n"
"\n"
"    To remove all 'Tested-by' tags in commit (or tag) messages:\n"
"      git filter-repo --message-callback 'return re.sub(br\"\\nTested-"
"by:.*\", \"\", message)'\n"
"\n"
"    To remove all .DS_Store files:\n"
"      git filter-repo --filename-callback 'return None if "
"os.path.basename(filename) == b\".DS_Store\" else filename'\n"
"\n"
"    Note that if BODY resolves to a filename, then the contents of that "
"file\n"
"    will be used as the BODY in the callback function.\n"
"\n"
"    The --file-info-callback has a more involved function callback; for "
"it the\n"
"    following code will be compiled and called:\n"
"      def file_info_callback(filename, mode, blob_id, value):\n"
"        BODY\n"
"\n"
"    It is designed to be used in cases where filtering depends on both\n"
"    filename and contents (and maybe mode).  It is called for file "
"changes\n"
"    other than deletions (since deletions have no file contents to "
"operate\n"
"    on).  This callback is expected to return a tuple of (filename, mode,"
"\n"
"    blob_id).  It can make use of the following functions from the value\n"
"    instance:\n"
"      value.get_contents_by_identifier(blob_id) -> contents (bytestring)\n"
"      value.get_size_by_identifier(blob_id) -> size_of_blob (int)\n"
"      value.insert_file_with_contents(contents) -> blob_id\n"
"      value.is_binary(contents) -> bool\n"
"      value.apply_replace_text(contents) -> new_contents (bytestring)\n"
"    and can read/write the following data member from the value instance:"
"\n"
"      value.data (dict)\n"
"\n"
"    The filename can be used for renaming the file similar to\n"
"    --filename-callback (or None to drop the change), and mode is one\n"
"    of b'100644', b'100755', b'120000', or b'160000'.\n"

"\n"
"    To get a bunch of reports mentioning renames that have occurred in\n"

"    directory, extension, or blob-id:\n"
"      git filter-repo --analyze\n"

"    (These reports can help you choose how to filter your repo; it can\n"
"    be useful to re-run this command after filtering to regenerate the\n"
"    report and verify the changes look correct.)\n"
"\n"
"    To extract the history that touched just 'guides' and "
"'tools/releases':\n"
"      git filter-repo --path guides/ --path tools/releases\n"
"\n"
"    To remove foo.zip and bar/baz/zips from every revision in history:\n"
"      git filter-repo --path foo.zip --path bar/baz/zips/ --invert-paths\n"
"\n"
"    To replace the text 'password' with 'p455w0rd':\n"
"      git filter-repo --replace-text <(echo \"password==>p455w0rd\")\n"
"\n"
"    To use the current version of the .mailmap file to update authors,\n"
"    committers, and taggers throughout history and make it permanent:\n"
"      git filter-repo --use-mailmap\n"
"\n"
"    To extract the history of 'src/', rename all files to have a new "
"leading\n"
"    directory 'my-module' (e.g. src/foo.java -> my-module/src/foo.java), "
