## Algorithm

1. If both users have the same aspect of typology in the first position, the type of relationship is "Philia".
2. If the users' second and third aspects of typology match, or if the first and fourth aspects match, the type of relationship is "Agape".
3. If the first aspect of typology of one user matches the third aspect of the other (or vice versa), the type of relationship is "Eros".
4. If the second aspect of typology of one user matches the fourth aspect of the other (or vice versa), the type of relationship is "Eros".

After determining the type of relationship, we calculate the comfort of the relationship based on the type:

- Philia: comfort = 2
- Agape: comfort = 4
- Eros: comfort = -2

## Python Code Example

```python
class RelationshipCalculator:
    """A class to calculate the relationship type and comfort score between two users based on their typology aspects."""

    def __init__(self, user1, user2):
        """Initialize the class with two users."""
        self.user1 = user1
        self.user2 = user2

    def determine_relationship_type(self):
        """Determine the type of relationship between the two users."""
        if self.user1[0] == self.user2[0]:
            return "Philia"
        if (self.user1[1] == self.user2[1] and self.user1[2] == self.user2[2]) or (self.user1[0] == self.user2[3] and self.user1[3] == self.user2[0]):
            return "Agape"
        if self.user1[0] == self.user2[2] or self.user1[2] == self.user2[0]:
            return "Eros"
        if self.user1[1] == self.user2[3] or self.user1[3] == self.user2[1]:
            return "Eros"

    def compute_comfort_score(self, relationship_type):
        """Compute the comfort score based on the type of relationship."""
        comfort_scores = {"Philia": 2, "Agape": 4, "Eros": -2}
        return comfort_scores.get(relationship_type, 0)

# Example Usage
user1 = ['typologyAspect1', 'typologyAspect2', 'typologyAspect3', 'typologyAspect4']
user2 = ['typologyAspect4', 'typologyAspect3', 'typologyAspect2', 'typologyAspect1']

calculator = RelationshipCalculator(user1, user2)
relationship_type = calculator.determine_relationship_type()
comfort_score = calculator.compute_comfort_score(relationship_type)

print(f"Relationship Type: {relationship_type}, Comfort Score: {comfort_score}")
