## Algorithm

1. If both users have the same aspect of typology in the first position, the type of relationship is "Philia".
2. If the users' second and third aspects of typology match, or if the first and fourth aspects match, the type of relationship is "Agape".
3. If the first aspect of typology of one user matches the third aspect of the other (or vice versa), the type of relationship is "Eros".
4. If the second aspect of typology of one user matches the fourth aspect of the other (or vice versa), the type of relationship is "Eros".

After determining the type of relationship, we calculate the comfort of the relationship based on the type:

- Philia: comfort = 2
- Agape: comfort = 4
- Eros: comfort = -2

## Python Code Example

```python
def determine_relationship_type(user1, user2):
    if user1[0] == user2[0]:
        return "Philia"
    if (user1[1] == user2[1] and user1[2] == user2[2]) or (user1[0] == user2[3] and user1[3] == user2[0]):
        return "Agape"
    if user1[0] == user2[2] or user1[2] == user2[0]:
        return "Eros"
    if user1[1] == user2[3] or user1[3] == user2[1]:
        return "Eros"

def compute_comfort_score(relationship_type):
    if relationship_type == "Philia":
        return 2
    if relationship_type == "Agape":
        return 4
    if relationship_type == "Eros":
        return -2

# Example Usage
user1 = ['typologyAspect1', 'typologyAspect2', 'typologyAspect3', 'typologyAspect4']
user2 = ['typologyAspect4', 'typologyAspect3', 'typologyAspect2', 'typologyAspect1']

relationship_type = determine_relationship_type(user1, user2)
comfort_score = compute_comfort_score(relationship_type)
print(relationship_type, comfort_score)
