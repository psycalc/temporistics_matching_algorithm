# Plan for Engaging Researchers

Our overarching mission is to solve the problem of human compatibility through open collaboration and data sharing. The project currently uses many experimental values (for example, compatibility scores). To increase scientific validity and foster further development, we need to attract researchers and people with analytical mindsets. Below is a list of steps that can help interest scientists and get them involved.

## 1. Prepare Scientific Documentation

- **Describe the current algorithms**. Document in detail what data are used and how compatibility scores are calculated.
- **Highlight unresolved questions**. Clearly state which parts of the logic require analysis and experiments.
- **Publish sample data**. Provide examples of current calculations and explain which parameters can be varied.

## 2. Create Communication Channels

- **Forum or mailing list**. Set up a space where scientists can discuss ideas and propose changes.
- **Open meetings**. Hold regular online sessions or webinars to demonstrate new results and collect feedback.

## 3. Ensure Openness of Code and Data

- **Public repository**. Maintain a GitHub repository with detailed instructions for deployment and running tests.
- **Data access**. Provide sample datasets (or a way to generate them) so researchers can reproduce results and suggest improvements.
- **Issue tracker**. Create a list of current problems and invite participants to propose solutions.

## 4. Encourage Scientific Publications

- **Offer co-authorship**. When using contributions from researchers in the project, offer them co-authorship when publishing papers or reports.
- **Share results**. Publish intermediate findings and calculations to demonstrate progress and interesting discoveries.

## 5. Organize a Small Grant Fund (if possible)

- **Financial motivation**. Even a small grant or funding for equipment or software can draw researchers' attention.

## 6. Prepare Informational Materials

- **Overview articles**. Write an introductory article about the project's goal and potential research directions.
- **Examples of successful cases**. Describe where similar approaches are already used and what can be achieved by studying the project data.

## 7. Strengthen Ties with Academic Institutions

- **Collaborate with universities**. Offer students and graduate students topics for theses and course papers.
- **Scientific conferences**. Participate in relevant conferences and seminars, presenting the project to a wide audience.

This plan will help make the project more open and attractive to researchers, which will improve the quality of results and reveal new paths for development.
