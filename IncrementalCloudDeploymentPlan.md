# Incremental Cloud Deployment Plan

This document outlines a phased approach for launching and scaling a new project with minimal upfront investment. Start with free or low-cost services, then expand resources as the user base grows.

## 1. Initial Stage (minimal costs)
- **Use free or trial resources**
  - **AWS Free Tier:** run a small VM (`t2.micro` or `t3.micro`) for a year at no cost.
  - **Azure Free Services:** similar free VM (`B1S`) for a limited period plus a set of other free services.
  - **DigitalOcean:** no fully free machines, but provides an initial credit (~$100 for 60 days) and the smallest droplet (512 MB RAM) around $4–5/month.
- **Minimal server configuration**
  - 1 vCPU, 512 MB or 1 GB RAM, 20–25 GB SSD.
  - Deploy essential software (Docker + Docker Compose, PostgreSQL, web server, your code).
- **Basic monitoring and backups**
  - Enable simple metrics (CPU, disk, memory).
  - Schedule regular database dumps and store backups in cloud storage (S3, Azure Blob, or Spaces).

## 2. First Users (up to a few hundred people)
- **Slightly increase resources**
  - Move to a plan with 1–2 GB RAM and better CPU. For example: DigitalOcean 1 GB (~$6/month) or 2 GB (~$12/month); AWS `t3.small` (2 GB, from $0.02/hour); Azure `B1MS` (2 GB).
- **Use a managed database**
  - Reduce administration overhead via DigitalOcean Managed Database (~$15/month minimum), Amazon RDS, or Azure Database if within budget.
- **Automatic backups and detailed monitoring**
  - Enable host-provided backups (usually +20% to cost) or continue manual ones.
  - Add log collection and alerts using free tiers (Grafana Cloud, Prometheus + Alertmanager, or CloudWatch).

## 3. Increased Load (hundreds to a couple thousand users)
- **Vertical scaling or containerization**
  - If one server suffices, increase its specs (4–8 GB RAM, 2–4 vCPU).
  - Consider Docker deployment in cloud container services (AWS ECS/Fargate, Azure Container Instances, DigitalOcean App Platform).
- **Load distribution and data storage**
  - Use cloud storage (S3, Azure Blob, Spaces) for static content instead of local disks.
  - Add a CDN if needed (CloudFront, Azure CDN, DigitalOcean CDN).
- **More advanced monitoring and logging**
  - Switch to paid plans or host your own stack (Prometheus, Grafana, Loki/Elastic).

## 4. Stable Project (thousands of users, consistent reliability)
- **Horizontal scaling**
  - Move to a Kubernetes cluster (EKS, AKS, or DigitalOcean Kubernetes).
  - Use managed databases with replicas for high availability (RDS/Azure Database, DigitalOcean Managed DB).
- **Load balancers and auto-scaling**
  - Configure AWS ELB/Azure Load Balancer/DigitalOcean Load Balancer and set up auto-scaling based on metrics.
- **Resilience and backups**
  - Set up cross-region replication, verify backups regularly, and implement disaster recovery procedures.

## 5. Further Growth (large user base, high SLA)
- **Infrastructure as code and automation**
  - Manage resources with Terraform or Ansible.
  - Use advanced CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI).
- **Multiple regions and global traffic distribution**
  - Employ global DNS load balancers and deploy services in several regions (AWS Route53, Azure Traffic Manager, DigitalOcean Global Load Balancer).
- **Cost optimization**
  - Use Reserved or Spot instances (AWS) or equivalents.
  - Evaluate cheaper alternatives or self-hosted options where feasible.

Following this plan keeps initial expenses low while leaving ample room to scale if the project takes off.
