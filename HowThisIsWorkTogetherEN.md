## General Summary: Temporistics, Psychosophy and Socionics

These notes provide an accessible introduction for readers who may not be familiar with the underlying typologies. They are intended as a simplified summary rather than a comprehensive or final solution to the complex question of human compatibility.

### **1. Temporistics: Induction and Deduction of Time**
Temporistics operates with four aspects of time: **Past**, **Current**, **Future** and **Eternity**. These aspects manifest inductively or deductively depending on their position in a type:
- **Positions 1 and 4 (deductive):** a person acts according to established principles and an overall picture of time.
  - **1st position:** forms the main principle of interaction with time. For example, if "Future" is here, the person builds their activities around a general concept of the future.
  - **4th position:** the weak spot where a person tries to follow established principles without deep analysis.
- **Positions 2 and 3 (inductive):** a person gathers and processes information to draw conclusions or make plans.
  - **2nd position:** used for a flexible approach, forming conclusions from collected information.
  - **3rd position:** constantly gathers and analyzes data, adapting to the situation.

#### **Key conflict in temporistics:**
- **"I don't understand your time induction because I act deductively."** One person is guided by gathered information (induction) while the other follows a pre‑formed plan (deduction).

### **2. Psychosophy: Analysis and Synthesis of Aspects (Will, Logic, Physics, Emotions)**
In psychosophy each aspect (will, logic, physics, emotions) can be analytic or synthetic depending on its position:
- **Positions 1 and 4 (synthetic):** aspects are perceived holistically.
  - **1st position:** the person acts by integrating all elements of the aspect (for example, will as the ability to act as a whole driven by inner motivation).
  - **4th position:** the aspect is perceived integrally but the person feels a lack of it.
- **Positions 2 and 3 (analytic):** the person tends to analyze, breaking the aspect down into parts.
  - **2nd position:** actively uses and analyzes the aspect for decision making (e.g. logic here means forming convictions through detailed analysis).
  - **3rd position:** observant and critical, constantly evaluating whether the aspect is used correctly.

#### **Key conflict in psychosophy:**
- **"I don't understand your analysis because I act synthetically."** For example, someone with will in the 1st position acts decisively without analyzing details, whereas an analytic type (2nd or 3rd position) wants to carefully consider each step.

### **3. Socionics: Logical, Ethical, Sensory and Intuitive Modeling**
Socionics explains interaction through **information modeling** divided into four aspects:
- **Logical modeling:** building clear systems, structures and connections. A person who uses logic as a primary aspect (e.g. in the first position) tries to explain everything through rules and principles. Conflict arises when someone cannot understand or reproduce this logical model. The logician expects everything to be rational and systematic.
- **Ethical modeling:** focused on feelings, relationships and emotional exchange. For an ethicist (with ethics in the first position) it is crucial to understand how people feel and how emotions influence interaction. Conflict occurs when a logician tries to rationalize everything, ignoring emotional nuances.
- **Sensory modeling:** operates with concrete sensations and interaction with the material world. A person with strong sensing in the first position is oriented on what physically exists and can be perceived. Conflict arises when an intuitive type deals with abstract concepts and overlooks material reality.
- **Intuitive modeling:** building abstract, conceptual models of the future or possibilities. The intuitive type seeks to understand potential and possible paths of development based on intuition. Conflict arises when a sensing type demands concrete proof and explanations for what the intuitive perceives.

#### **Key conflict in socionics:**
- **"I cannot reproduce your perception model."** The logician cannot grasp the ethical models of the ethicist, and the sensor does not accept the abstract ideas of the intuitive. Each type perceives information through its own model, and conflict occurs when a person cannot adapt to the model of another.

### **Overall Connection: Induction, Deduction, Analysis, Synthesis and Modeling**
1. **Induction and Deduction** (Temporistics):
   - **Induction:** collecting and processing information about time (positions 2, 3).
   - **Deduction:** acting based on the overall picture of time (positions 1, 4).

2. **Analysis and Synthesis** (Psychosophy):
   - **Analysis:** breaking down aspects (will, logic, physics, emotions) for decision making (positions 2, 3).
   - **Synthesis:** perceiving aspects holistically for confident action (positions 1, 4).

3. **Modeling** (Socionics):
   - **Logical modeling:** creating systems and structures (logic).
   - **Ethical modeling:** understanding relationships and emotional exchange (ethics).
   - **Sensory modeling:** focusing on tangible, perceivable reality (sensing).
   - **Intuitive modeling:** building abstract concepts and predictions (intuition).

### **Final Summary**
- **Temporistics:** main conflict in using time — induction vs. deduction.
- **Psychosophy:** main conflict in approaches to personality aspects — analysis vs. synthesis.
- **Socionics:** main conflict in perceiving and reproducing information models — each type has its own logical, ethical, sensory or intuitive modeling.

These typologies help explain why people may not understand each other. All of these conflicts come down to differences in induction, deduction, analysis, synthesis and information modeling.
